The Scorecard will be composed of a tree of components--think of a webpage being diveded into nested boxes. The whole page
being the top-most component and, for example, the nav being a child compoent of the page.

Well designed components know only about their own UI and data. A components' data can be given to it by it's parent or subscribe
to it from a couple differnt sources. Components will subscribe to UX Scorecard data via a service. A components state (e.g., collapsed or expanded),
will be stored in the applications cache and subscribed to. This allows actions from one component to affect the state of another
without direct communication, and is how modern complex web application scale.

Components might be "dumb" and be only concerned with rendering markup in the simplest terms. These components are relatively trivial and akin to writing straight markup.
Other components are "smart" and might alter what or how something is displayed based on dynamic data, appliation state, environment (like device width),
or events like clicks, scroll position or timing events like animation keyframes.

The following estimates are based on available wireframes (still in flux) and conversations about how these static wireframes respond to various device widths, variable UX study data, etcetera.
